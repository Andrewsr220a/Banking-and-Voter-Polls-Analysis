The jupyter notebook of this data can be found in the __Pybank__ file 

In this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I reviewed a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.) I've created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## Analysis of Poll data

The jupyter notebook of this data can be found in the __PyPoll__ file 

In this project, i've been tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I reviewed a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
